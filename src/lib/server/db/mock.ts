    description: 'How does it work? $Solcapa is at the core of the MemeFi economy. You can use $Solcapa to mint new, unique $Solcapa NFTs permissionlessly, or burn $Solcapa NFTs to retrieve that sweet sweet $Solcapa back. Every time you burn a $Solcapa NFT, 100,000,000 $Solcapa is burnt forever. This demonstrates how deflation works in our system. The max supply of $Solcapa is 10,000,000,000. NFT mints arenâ€™t hard-capped but are limited by the $Solcapa supply. Each mint births a new unique Capa'
