    Seasons will be of varying lengths. Season 1 will last for 4 weeks.
  </p>

  <h1 class="martian-mono-extrabold glow">season 1 mission debrief</h1>

  <p>
    During Season 1 there will be questing system in place. On top of earning
    points, hefties, normies, chads and zombies are entitled to 100% of the fee
    revenue made from bonding curve trading.
  </p>

  <br />

  <br />

  <p>
    Those that register with coin.fun prior to Season 1 are eligible for trading
    fee share. If you join during Season 1 you will not share in the trading
    fees, but you are still able to earn points. Registering will be introduced
    some time before Season 1 begins.
  </p>
  <br />

  <p>
    The earlier you claim and register on coin.fun, the higher multiplier on the
    fees earned.
  </p>

  <br />
  <p>
    Season 1 revolves around the battle between the players. The starting split
    between the 4 player groups is 30% hefties, 20% normies, 40% chads and 10%
    zombies. These are the percentages for fee share. The final split depends on
    how many points each player group earns towards the end of the season 1. If
    hefties aren't earning any points, then the other groups will make their
    fees.

    <br />
    Do not forget that each app user may be in more than one player group. Main objectives
    of each group for season 1 will be:

    <br />

    1/ Hefties - register with coin.fun app, authorize their twitter account and
    DM us that they wish to participate. The more engaging your tweets about
    coin.fun the higher share of points you will be assigned. This then
    increases the chances that all hefties stay at 40% of all trading fees for
    that month. Moreover, you will be competing with other hefties for a share
    of those 40%. In this way, you are competing together with you fellow
    hefties versus zombies, chads and normies, whilst also at the same time you
    compete against them within your player category.

    <br />

    2/ Normies - ..

    <br />

    3/ Chads - ..

    <br />

    4/ Zombies - ..
  </p>

  <br />
  <p>Points estimates will be computed periodically throughout the day.</p>
